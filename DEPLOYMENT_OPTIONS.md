## 🚀 **Shuttle.rs Deployment Guide**

Shuttle.rs is a great platform for Rust deployment, but there are dependency conflicts between Shuttle and Solana SDK versions. Here are your deployment options:

### **Option 1: Quick Shuttle Test (Recommended)**

Let's deploy a basic version first to test Shuttle, then add Solana features:

```bash
# 1. Login to Shuttle
cargo shuttle login

# 2. Start a new project
cargo shuttle project start

# 3. Deploy
cargo shuttle deploy
```

### **Option 2: Alternative Deployment Platforms**

Since there are dependency conflicts, here are other great options:

#### **🌊 Railway.app**
```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login
railway login

# 3. Initialize
railway init

# 4. Deploy
railway up
```

#### **🔥 Fly.io**
```bash
# 1. Install flyctl
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# 2. Login
flyctl auth login

# 3. Launch
flyctl launch

# 4. Deploy
flyctl deploy
```

#### **☁️ Render.com**
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Render
2. Choose "Web Service"
3. Use build command: `cargo build --release`
4. Use start command: `./target/release/solana-http-server`

### **Option 3: Docker + Any Cloud**

Your project already has a Dockerfile! You can deploy to:
- Google Cloud Run
- AWS ECS
- Azure Container Instances
- DigitalOcean App Platform

```bash
# Build and push to any registry
docker build -t solana-http-server .
docker tag solana-http-server your-registry/solana-http-server
docker push your-registry/solana-http-server
```

### **Recommendation**

For immediate deployment with your current Solana features, I'd suggest:

1. **Railway.app** - Zero config deployment
2. **Fly.io** - Great for Rust apps
3. **Docker + Cloud Run** - Most flexible

Would you like me to help you set up any of these alternatives?
